# ai-charter Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview
- Product Name: ai-charter v1.0
- Problem Statement: Developers using AI-powered IDEs lack consistent ways to communicate project context and preferences to their AI assistants. This leads to inconsistent code suggestions and requires frequent correction of the AI's output.
- Target Users: Software developers using AI-powered IDEs who want to improve the quality and consistency of AI-generated code
- Key Value Proposition: ai-charter streamlines the process of creating comprehensive project documentation that AI assistants can use to understand project context and preferences, resulting in more accurate and consistent code suggestions.

## 2. Success Metrics
Primary Success Metrics:
- Reduction in the number of times developers need to correct AI-generated code
- Increase in the acceptance rate of AI-suggested code implementations

Secondary Metrics:
- Time saved in explaining project context to AI assistants
- Number of successfully generated project documentation sets

## 3. User Stories
- As a developer, I want to input my project's technical requirements so that my AI assistant understands my tech stack and constraints
- As a developer, I want to define code style preferences so that AI-generated code matches my project's conventions
- As a developer, I want to specify project architecture patterns so that AI suggestions align with my project's structure
- As a developer, I want to define UX flow diagrams using Mermaid syntax so that my AI assistant can understand project's user flows
- As a developer, I want to export documentation in a format my IDE can understand so that I can immediately start using it
- As a developer, I want to easily update project preferences when they change so that my AI assistant stays aligned with current requirements

## 4. Core Features

### Project Context Form
- Priority: Must Have
- Description: Interactive form that collects essential project information including tech stack, architecture preferences, and development guidelines
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Form captures all necessary technical requirements
  - Input fields use appropriate validation
  - Form state is preserved during the session
  - Users can review and edit inputs before generation

### Documentation Generation
- Priority: Must Have
- Description: Generates comprehensive documentation based on user inputs, creating multiple document types for different aspects of the project
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Generates high-level project overview
  - Generates technical stack documentation
  - Generates PRD (Product Requirements Document)
  - Generates code style guidelines
  - Generates UX flow diagrams
  - Generates architecture patterns documentation
  - Output is consistently formatted and complete

### Export Functionality
- Priority: Must Have
- Description: Exports documentation in formats compatible with major AI-powered IDEs
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Exports in markdown format
  - Maintains formatting and structure
  - Includes all necessary context markers for IDE consumption

### Document Preview
- Priority: Should Have
- Description: Allows users to preview generated documentation and make adjustments before export
- Acceptance Criteria:
